# virtual-wardrobe
Virtual Wardrobe Stylist is an AI-assisted fashion app built with Python and Streamlit that lets users upload, organize, and visually browse their wardrobe (shirts, pants, shoes). It smartly suggests complete outfits based on tag-based matching logic (e.g., color, season, style), and allows saving favorite combinations.
